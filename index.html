     Park Pause connects residents to infrastructure with viewpoints of select public parks. We foreground the places where memories form, are shaped into monuments, and re-enacted through events. In the USA, people in power decide the sites of a public park, what monuments are situated there, and what events take place. We can take that power and use it cultivate to true common places that compel casual appreciation, direct engagement, and cooperative ownership.
<br><br>
Park Pause is an open,Â cyber-physical participatory project. This particular site hosts an index of digital environments inspired by particular public parks.

    <h2>
      Monuments & Events
  </h2>
  <p>
    Public parks shape personal memories, personal memories dance with public memory, and soon a mythology arises. That mythology can be enacted through monuments and events: a statue, a tire swing, a game of tag, or a bazaar. These all provide common meaning within each individual's interaction with the park's landscape. 
  <br><br>
    Monuments are a type of sympathetic magic that propel public memory. They look like objects such as sculptures, signage, paved paths, and gardens. Events are the rituals that charge the magic of monuments. They are collective experiences enacted by groups with common traits.

      Cyberscapes of Memories & Dreams

  The following realms are charged with the unending creative potential of dreams. 
  These digital environments exist as event-monuments: interactive places that people can visit simultaneously through the magic mirror of a computer screen.
